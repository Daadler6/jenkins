**To Lint on Commit**

1. Install git-hooks => On a Mac `brew install git-hooks` - [Other](https://github.com/icefox/git-hooks/)
2. Setup on Repo => `git hooks --install`

**Bypass Lint**

If you have to bypass lint for a special commit that you will come back and clean (pushing something to a branch etc.) then you can bypass git hooks with adding `--no-verify` to your commit command.

**Understanding Linting Errors**

The linting rules are from JS Standard and React-Standard.  [Regular JS errors can be found with descriptions here](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/), while [React errors and descriptions can be found here](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react).
